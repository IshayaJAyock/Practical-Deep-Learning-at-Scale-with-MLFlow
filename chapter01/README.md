# Code for Chapter1

1. Installation of all dependencies

   a) Set up a new virtual environment dl_model and install lightnining-flash[all] latest version. Note that due to the rapid change
      of lightning-flash API, sometimes backward incompatibility might happen. We will update this README to reflect any new change.
     
      conda create -n dl_model python==3.8.10
      conda activate dl_model
      pip install -r requirements.txt
     

   b) You need to have conda installed first before you run the above command

   c) Please refer to `https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html#regular-installation` for miniconda installation on your local environment
   
2. A first deep learning model
3. To run the first deep learning model, type `python first_dl.py` in your command line.
